# CI/CD Workflow Changes Summary

## Overview

Removed automatic version bumping and streamlined the release process to ensure intentional, high-quality releases with proper semantic versioning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Workflows

#### ‚ùå `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` (DELETED)
- **Reason**: Automatic version bumps on every push create poor version numbering
- **Impact**: No more unwanted version increments
- **Replacement**: Manual version control in `Cargo.toml`

#### ‚ùå `.github/workflows/github-packages.yml` (DELETED)
- **Reason**: GitHub Packages requires Docker setup and wasn't working properly
- **Impact**: Simplified distribution, focus on crates.io
- **Alternative**: Direct `.crate` file downloads from GitHub Releases

### 2. Updated Workflows

#### ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (UPDATED)
- **Changes**:
  - Only runs on PRs and code changes (not documentation-only)
  - Added path filtering to avoid unnecessary runs
  - Removed automatic version bump references
- **Purpose**: Quality checks only (tests, clippy, formatting, docs)

#### ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/release.yml` (UPDATED)
- **Changes**:
  - Removed GitHub Packages publishing
  - Added clear documentation about manual release process
  - Simplified permissions (removed `packages: write`)
- **Trigger**: Only when version tags (`v*.*.*`) are manually pushed
- **Purpose**: Publish to crates.io and create GitHub releases

### 3. New Documentation

#### üìÑ `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` (NEW)
Complete guide for maintainers on how to:
- Update version in `Cargo.toml`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`
- Create and push version tags
- Trigger automated publishing

### 4. Updated Documentation

#### üìù `README.md`
- Removed GitHub Packages badge
- Added link to Release Process documentation
- Updated documentation section

#### üìù `PACKAGES.md`
- Renamed from "GitHub Packages" to "Installation Guide"
- Updated to reflect crates.io as primary distribution
- Clarified GitHub Releases as backup method

#### üìù `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Updated Release Process section
- Changed from "automatic" to "manual" releases
- Updated commit message guidelines (removed version bump references)
- Changed terminology from "Version Bump" to "Semver Impact"

## Release Process Now

### For Contributors
1. Make changes and submit PR
2. Use conventional commits (for clarity, not auto-versioning)
3. Maintainers handle all release concerns

### For Maintainers
1. Update `Cargo.toml` version following semver
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes
3. Commit: `git commit -am "chore: release v0.x.x"`
4. Create tag: `git tag v0.x.x`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v0.x.x`
6. GitHub Actions automatically publishes to crates.io

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Intentional Releases**: Every version is deliberate and planned  
‚úÖ **Proper Semver**: Maintainers ensure correct version numbers  
‚úÖ **Clean Version History**: No accidental or intermediate versions  
‚úÖ **Simplified CI**: Faster builds, runs only when needed  
‚úÖ **Better Control**: Maintainers decide when to release  
‚úÖ **Quality Focus**: Version numbers reflect actual releases, not commits

## Testing

All changes verified:
- ‚úÖ Library tests pass
- ‚úÖ Clippy checks pass (no warnings, no dead code)
- ‚úÖ Formatting correct
- ‚úÖ Documentation builds
- ‚úÖ Workflows syntax valid

## Migration Notes

### What Changed for Users
- **Nothing**: Users still install via `cargo add zfish` from crates.io
- Distribution remains the same

### What Changed for Contributors
- **Nothing**: Still submit PRs, still use conventional commits
- No need to think about versioning

### What Changed for Maintainers
- **Manual versioning**: Must update `Cargo.toml` before release
- **Manual tagging**: Must create and push version tags
- **More control**: Decide exactly when to release

## Rollback Plan

If automatic releases are needed again:
1. Restore `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` from git history
2. Update documentation to reflect automatic process
3. Ensure `CARGO_TOKEN` secret is configured

However, the current manual process provides better quality control and is recommended.
